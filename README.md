# README #

This is the portable distribution version of the Summarizer
app, built for our Senior Capstone project at California
Baptist University.

## Usage Details ##

### How do I get it set up? ###

* Download the contents (all).
* Run the shortcut on the top level.
* _N.B._ The shortcut sometimes does
  not work; if this happens, the executable
  it is supposed to link to is "Summarizer.exe"
  in "Summarizer App > Release".

### Contribution guidelines ###

Development on this project is complete
for the time-being.

### Note on large documents ###

For some longer documents (e.g. war_and_peace.txt,
kjv.txt, and moby_dick.txt in the folder "Summarizer
test documents"), the app will seem to freeze. Fret not!
It is still working; it is busy in the background
loading the document and generating the "summaries"
(even if you click on it and Windows labels the app
as "Not Responding"). We did not design any "loading"
graphic element to indicate internal activity.
