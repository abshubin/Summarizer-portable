This is the "Document Summarizer" app.

To run the app, simply click on the shortcut
in this folder ("Run Summarizer (shortcut)").

NOTE: For some longer documents (e.g. war_and_peace.txt,
kjv.txt, and moby_dick.txt in the folder "Summarizer
test documents"), the app will seem to freeze. Fret not!
It is still working; it is busy in the background
loading the document and generating the "summaries"
(even if you click on it and Windows labels the app
as "Not Responding").
